### üåé Rotate the globe

Your users can see the data on a globe, but wouldn't it be awesome to make that globe spin automatically?[Spin me right round](./examples/rotate-the-globe.html)

```js

function animate() {
  const camera = view.camera.clone();
  camera.position.longitude += 1;
  view.goTo(camera);
  requestAnimationFrame(function() {
    if (!view.interacting) {
      animate();
    }
  });
}

// start animating on some event (click, view ready, etc.)
animate();

```

### ‚úàÔ∏è Create a tour from a set of points

Creating a tour is super easy, you can either do that from a set of camera positions, of slides or just some (view)points. [Take me on a tour](./examples/create-a-tour.html)

```js

function startAnimation(slideNo) {
  if (slideNo < webscene.presentation.slides.length) {

    const slide = webscene.presentation.slides.getItemAt(slideNo);
    document.getElementById("description").innerHTML = slide.title.text;

    view.goTo(slide.viewpoint, {duration: 3000})
        .then(function(){

          window.setTimeout(function(){
            startAnimation(slideNo + 1);
          }, 5000)
        })
        .otherwise(function(err){
          console.log(err);
        });
      }
}

window.setTimeout(function(){
  startAnimation(0);
}, 5000);
```

### ‚åõ Show when all layers finished drawing

Sometimes you want to wait for all the layers to finish drawing before starting an animation or baking a cake. This snippet can come in handy in those critical moments. [Are my layers there yet?](./hello.html)

```js

// some snippet will be displayed here
```

### üé• Pretty print camera

Figuring out the right numbers for camera position, tilt and heading made easy. The `view` should be set on the `window`. Run this code snippet in the console: [Show me the camera](./hello.html)

```js

(function() {
  var p = view.camera.position;

  if (p.spatialReference.isWebMercator || p.spatialReference.isWGS84) {
    console.log(`
{
  position: [${p.longitude.toFixed(8)}, ${p.latitude.toFixed(8)}, ${p.z.toFixed(5)}],
  heading: ${view.camera.heading.toFixed(2)},
  tilt: ${view.camera.tilt.toFixed(2)}
}`);
  }
  else {
    console.log(`
{
  position: { x: ${p.x.toFixed(5)}, y: ${p.y.toFixed(5)}, z: ${p.z.toFixed(3)}, spatialReference: ${p.spatialReference.wkid} },
  heading: ${view.camera.heading.toFixed(2)},
  tilt: ${view.camera.tilt.toFixed(2)}
}`);
  }
})();
```

### üëÄ Look around

The one where the camera turns around to see what's behind it. Seriously now, with this code the camera rotates 360 degrees around its position. [Let's have a look around](./hello.html)
